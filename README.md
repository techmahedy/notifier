## About Doppar Queue

> **Note:** This repository contains the core code of the Doppar framework queue package. If you want to build an application using Doppar, visit the main [Doppar repository](https://github.com/doppar/doppar).

Doppar queue system offers robust features including multiple queue support for organizing jobs by priority or category, automatic retry logic with configurable attempts and delays, and comprehensive failed job tracking for easier debugging. It supports delayed execution for scheduling jobs in the future, graceful shutdown handling to safely stop workers, and built-in memory management that automatically restarts workers when limits are exceeded.
